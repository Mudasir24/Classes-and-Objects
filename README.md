# Classes-and-Objects

This Python program, 'classes_and_objs.py', shows the principles of object-oriented programming through the creation of a class named 'Book'. The class has attributes such as 'title', 'author', and 'genre', representing key information about a book.

1. Designing the Book Class:
    - The 'Book' class is designed to encapsulate book-related information, allowing for organized data representation and manipulation.

2. Creating an Instance:
    - An instance of the 'Book' class is created using custom values for 'title', 'author', and 'genre'.

3. Setting and Displaying Information:
    - The __init()__ method is used to store the book information. 
    -The display_information() method shows the book information.

This program demonstrates how to encapsulate and manage book information using object-oriented programming principles.
